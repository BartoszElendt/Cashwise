Key Features

Budgeting
- Users can set budgets for different categories such as housing, food, transportation, and entertainment.
- The application tracks expenses and provides updates on how well users are adhering to their budgets.

Expense Tracking
Users can add and classify their expenses, allowing the application to generate reports on spending patterns.
Expenses can be categorized, labeled, and associated with information such as names, dates, and locations.
Expense Reporting
Users can generate expense reports to gain insights into their spending habits.
Reports can be generated for specific date ranges, providing a clear picture of spending trends and the most significant budget categories.
Income Tracking
Users can add and categorize their income sources.
The application takes income into account when calculating net income and the user's financial situation.
Alerts are generated if expenses exceed income.
Financial Planning
The application provides users with suggestions for improving their financial situation, such as reducing expenses, increasing income, and saving.
Savings Goals
Users can set savings goals, such as saving for a down payment on a house or a vacation.
The application allows users to track their progress towards achieving these goals.
Business Requirements
The application should store user budget and expense information in a database.
When a user incurs an expense, it should be assigned to the appropriate expense category, and the application should update the remaining budget for that category.
Expense reports should be generated, displaying expenses in the context of time, categories, and other input data (location, dates, transaction names, etc.).
The application should store user income information in the database and take it into account when calculating budgets.
Alerts should be triggered if expenses exceed income.
